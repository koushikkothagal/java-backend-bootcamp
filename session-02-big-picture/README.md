# The goal
TODO
Overview of what we'll be learning but from the perspective of the final objective. 
What do you want to be able to do after the bootcamp ends?
Mainly placeholder at this point. It makes sense to visit this and add specifics after the curriculum is finalized

# Understanding a web application

A web application is a program that runs on a web server and is accessed over the internet through a web browser. When a user navigates to the URL of a web application in their web browser, the browser sends a request to the web server where the application is hosted. 

The web server then processes the request, which can include querying a database, performing calculations, or executing other logic. The server generates a response, which is typically in the form of an HTML document, and sends it back to the user's browser. 

The browser then renders the HTML and displays the web page to the user. The user can interact with the web page by clicking buttons, filling out forms, and so on. These actions trigger additional requests to the server, which then sends back additional responses, allowing the user to interact with the web application in real time.

## Application architecture

The three-tier architecture is a software design pattern commonly used in the development of web applications. It is comprised of three distinct layers: the presentation layer, the application logic layer, and the data layer.

The presentation layer is the user interface, which is the part of the application that the user interacts with. This layer is responsible for the look and feel of the application, and is typically implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It communicates with the application logic layer to receive data and present it to the user.

The application logic layer contains the business logic of the application. This is where the bulk of the application's functionality is implemented. It communicates with both the presentation layer to receive user input and provide data for rendering, and the data layer to retrieve and store data.

The data layer is responsible for providing an interface to the data stored in a database. It abstracts the underlying database technology, making it easy to switch to a different database system without changing the application logic. This layer communicates with the application logic layer to retrieve and store data, which is in turn called by the presentation layer.

The separation of the application into these distinct layers allows for greater flexibility and maintainability, as each layer can be developed and modified independently of the others.

Note: 
This architecture is a common starting point for web applications and is surely the simplest. There are several other advanced architecture styles - like distributed microservices. For most of this bootcamp, keep this three tier architecture in mind. Once you are comfortable with this model, we will be switching to the distributed model and looking at more advanced architectures.

## Frontend vs Backend
The front end and back end of a web application refer to the different components that make up the overall system.

The front end, also known as the client-side, is the portion of the application that is responsible for the user interface and the way the user interacts with the application. It is what the user sees and interacts with when they visit a website. The front end is typically implemented using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It communicates with the back end to retrieve data and display it to the user, as well as to send user input to the back end for processing.

The back end, also known as the server-side, is responsible for the behind-the-scenes functionality of the application. It handles tasks such as processing user input, querying databases, performing calculations, and generating responses. The back end is typically implemented using languages such as Python, Ruby, or Java, and it may use technologies such as web frameworks, databases, and APIs.

In summary, the front end is responsible for the user interface, and how user interacts with the application, while the back end handles the application logic, calculations, database and server-side tasks.

The front end and back end communicate with each other using a variety of techniques, such as HTTP requests and responses. When a user interacts with a front-end feature of the website, such as a form submission, it sends an HTTP request to the server, the back-end, which then processes the data, interacts with the database if needed, and sends a response back to the front-end to be displayed to the user.

## How a web request works

When a JavaScript client application makes an HTTP request to a Java back-end service, the following steps occur:

- The JavaScript client application creates _request_ object. This object contains information such as the method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT), the URL, and any data that needs to be sent with the request.
- The JavaScript client sends the request to the server using the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API. This is an asynchronous operation, which means the JavaScript code will continue to execute while the request is being processed.
- The request is received by the back-end service, which is typically implemented using a Java web framework such as Spring. The framework extracts the information from the request, such as the method and the URL, and routes it to the appropriate code in the back-end service.
- The back-end service processes the request, which can include querying a database, performing calculations, or executing other logic. 
- The back-end service generates a response, which is typically in the form of an HTTP response object. The response contains information such as the status code (e.g. 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and any data that needs to be sent back to the client.
- The response is sent back to the JavaScript client application. The JavaScript client receives the response and can process the data or update the user interface accordingly.

It's important to note that the request and response are sent over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, which provides a standardized way for web clients and servers to communicate. And also to note that the above is a common pattern, with many variations and alternatives using different technologies and protocols such as WebSockets, gRPC and so on.

In this bootcamp, we will focus on the most popular protocol used for this today - using HTTP and HTTPS.

~/openjdk19$ wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk19.0.2/fdb695a9d9064ad6b064dc6df578380c/7/GPL/openjdk-19.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```
![](assets/java_setup_linux/03downloadjava.png)

6.	List the files in openjdk19 directory and extract the downloaded tar ball.
```sh
~/openjdk19$ tar -xvf openjdk-19.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```
![](assets/java_setup_linux/04extractjava.png)

7.	List the files again:
```sh
~/openjdk19$ ll
```
Navigate to extracted directory (jdk-19.0.2)
```sh
~/openjdk19$ cd jdk-19.0.2
```
Get the absolute path of directory:
```sh
~/openjdk19/jdk-19.0.2$ pwd
```
![](assets/java_setup_linux/05getabsolutepath.png)

8.	This the Path where openjdk has been downloaded and extracted. Make a Note of this path.

### Setting up Java in PATH variable and JAVA_HOME variable.

1.	Open the .bashrc file in your home directory in any text editor.
```sh
~/openjdk19$ nano ~/.bashrc
```
2.	Navigate to end of the file and make below entries in the file:
```sh
export JAVA_HOME=/home/mohit/openjdk19/jdk-19.0.2
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
![](assets/java_setup_linux/06editbashrc.png)

3.	Save the file and exit the editor.

(For nano editor, use ‘Ctrl + X’ to exit. Editor will ask confirmation to save changes to file. Just press Enter key to make changes in .bashrc file).

4.	(Optional) Verify if changes are saved properly by listing the content of file.
```sh
~/openjdk$ cat ~/.bashrc
```
![](assets/java_setup_linux/07catbashrc.png)

5.	Execute below command to ensure changes are applied.
```sh
~/openjdk10$ source ~/.bashrc
```
![](assets/java_setup_linux/08applychanges.png)

### Verifying Java setup:

Run the below commands to check to Java is correctly set.
```sh
~/openjdk19$ echo $JAVA_HOME
~/openjdk19$ java -version
~/openjdk19$ javac -version
```

   To get to the home directory:
   ```sh  
   $ cd ~
   ``` 

   To see all of the files in the current directory:
   ```sh  
   $ ls
   ```

   There file name of "openjdk-19.0.2_macos-aarch64_bin.tar.gz" or "openjdk-19.0.2_macos-x64_bin.tar.gz" should be in your home directory.  


4. Make a directory named "OpenJDK" in the home directory by      entering the following.  

   ```sh  
   $ mkdir OpenJDK
   ```   

5. Use the following command extract and move the files into the "OpenJDK" directory. 

   For Intel Processor:
   ```sh  
   $ tar -xf openjdk-19.0.2_macos-x64_bin.tar.gz -C $HOME/OpenJDK
   ```  

   For Apple Silicon Processor:
   ```sh  
   $ tar -xf openjdk-19.0.2_macos-aarch64_bin.tar.gz -C $HOME/OpenJDK
   ```

6. Verify that the files exist by entering the following into the terminal to get to the "bin" directory.

   ```sh  
   $ cd OpenJDK/jdk-19.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home/bin
   ```  

7. Check if the Java runtime environment (JRE) and the Java compiler exist by entering the following.

   ```sh  
   $ java -version  
   openjdk version 19.0.2 2023-01-17  
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 19.0.2+7-44)  
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0.2+7-44, mixed mode, sharing)
   ```  
      
   ```sh  
   $ javac -version  
   javac 19.0.2
   ```  


8. Set up home and PATH environment variables by entering the following.

   ```sh  
   $ cat >> .zshrc  
   export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/OpenJDK/jdk-19.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```  

   If it freezes, hit Crtl+C.  

9. You can verify that the home and PATH environment variables are in the file.

   ```sh  
   $ cat .zshrc
   export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/OpenJDK/jdk-19.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ``` 

10. Close and reopen the terminal. If everything was successful, you can check for the version of JRE and the Java Compiler from the home directory.

      ```sh  
      $ java -version  
      openjdk version 19.0.2 2023-01-17  
      OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 19.0.2+7-44)  
      OpenJDK  64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0.2+7-44, mixed mode, sharing)
      ```  
         
      ```sh
