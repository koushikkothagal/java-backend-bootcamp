# Homework

## Part 1
- Create a new repo on GitHub to store your bootcamp notes - it can be a directory of markdown files, images, whatever else. You can call it `javabrains-bootcamp-notes`. Your notes repo will be `@yourid/javabrains-bootcamp-notes` Note: This is entirely different from the bootcamp repo
- Clone the notes repo locally
- Add a single markdown file with session 2's notes
- Check in the changes and push to remote. Go to GitHub, navigate to your notes repo and ensure your file shows up there

## Part 2

- Clone it and open it locally
- Add a line to [this file](student-notes-repos.md) with a link to your notes repo from Part 1
- Push your changes
- Verify that your changes show up in your forked version of the repo
- Create a PR for this source repo (https://github.com/koushikkothagal/java-backend-bootcamp)
