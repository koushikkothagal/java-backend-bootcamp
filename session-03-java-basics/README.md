Explains concepts of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Assignment

### Basic Syntax
Write a program that takes in two numbers from the user and prints out the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers.

### Data Types
Create a program that takes in a person's name, age, and salary, and prints out the person's name, age, and salary in the format "Name: [name], Age: [age], Salary: [salary]".

### Operators
Write a program that takes in two numbers from the user and prints out the result of the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and increment/decrement

### Control Structures
Write a program that takes in a number from the user, and prints out whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Arrays
Create a program that takes in a list of integers from the user and prints out the largest number in the list.

### Methods
Create a program that takes in a string from the user and prints out the number of vowels in the string.

### Object-Oriented Programming
Create a program that defines a class called "Rectangle" which has two properties: length and width. Write a method that calculates the area of the rectangle.

Create a class hierarchy for a simple simulation of a zoo. The base class should be "Animal", which includes common properties such as name, weight, and age. Create several subclasses for specific types of animals, such as "Lions", "Tigers", and "Bears", each of which inherits from the "Animals" class and adds its own unique properties and methods. Include polymorphism by creating a "feed" method for each animal subclass that behaves differently depending on the type of animal it is called on.
Create enclosure classes that can "house" different types of animals. Implement an `add` method to add an animal to an enclosure. Have the enclosure check to make sure a herbivore and a carnivore animal aren't added to the same eclosure.
