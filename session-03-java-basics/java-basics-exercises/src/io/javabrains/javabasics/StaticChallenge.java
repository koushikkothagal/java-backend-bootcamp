/*
Create a class `Rectangle` with the following attributes: `width`, `height`, and a static variable `numOfRectangles` which will keep track of the number of rectangles created.

1.  Create a constructor that takes the width and height as arguments and sets the values of the `width` and `height` instance variables.
2.  Create a method `getArea` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.
3.  Create a method `getPerimeter` that calculates and returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
4.  Create a method `getNumOfRectangles` that returns the value of the `numOfRectangles` static variable.
5.  In this main method, create several `Rectangle` objects, calculate and print their area and perimeter, and finally print the number of rectangles created without keeping count in this class.
