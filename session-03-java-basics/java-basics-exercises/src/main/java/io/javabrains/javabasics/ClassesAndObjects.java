/*
1.  Create a class called `Car` with member variables for the make, model, and year of the car.
2.  Create a constructor method for the `Car` class that initializes the member variables.
3.  Create getter methods for the make, model, and year.
4.  Create a `toString` method that returns a string representation of the car in the form "year make model".
5.  In the `main` method of this class, create a `Car` object with a make, model, and year of your choice.
6.  Use the member variables and methods of the `Car` class to print the make, model, and year of the car.
7.  The expected output of the program is:

```
Make: Toyota
Model: Camry
Year: 2020
Details: 2020 Toyota Camry
```
