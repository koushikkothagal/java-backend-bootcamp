# Exception handling

# Exceptions in Java

Java provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions, which are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as attempting to access an array index that is out of bounds, or trying to read from a file that does not exist.

Java provides two main types of exceptions: checked and unchecked.

## Checked exceptions

Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. These exceptions must be handled by the program, either by catching the exception or declaring that the method throws the exception. Examples of checked exceptions include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `ClassNotFoundException`.

## Unchecked exceptions

Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. These exceptions are typically caused by programming errors and do not need to be handled by the program. Examples of unchecked exceptions include `NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException`, and `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Java also has the `Error` class, which represents a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Examples of errors include `OutOfMemoryError` and `StackOverflowError`.

To handle exceptions in Java, the programmer can use try-catch blocks. A `try` block encloses the code that might throw an exception, and a `catch` block handles the exception if it is thrown. The general syntax for a try-catch block is as follows:

```java
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // code to handle the exception
}
```

It's also possible to have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

```java
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle IOException
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // code to handle SQLException
}
```

A method can also throw an exception using the `throw` statement. The `throw` statement is used to create a new exception object and throw it. The general syntax for the throw statement is as follows:

```java
throw new ExceptionType("Error message");
```

A method can also specify that it throws an exception using the `throws` clause. The `throws` clause is used to indicate that a method might throw an exception. The general syntax for the `throws` clause is as follows:

```java
public void methodName() throws ExceptionType {
    // code that might throw an exception
}
```

Finally, The `finally` block is an optional block of code that follows the try and catch blocks. The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This block is typically used to release resources such as file handles, database connections, etc.

```java
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // code to handle the exception
} finally {
    // code to release resources
}
```

You can use the try-with-resources statement to automatically close resources, this statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement.

```java
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
    // code that uses the file input stream
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle the IOException
}
```

In this example, the `FileInputStream` is automatically closed at the end of the `try` block, even if an `IOException` is thrown. This eliminates the need for a finally block to close the resource.

## The importance of throwing and catching specific exception types

When working with exceptions in Java, it's important to throw and catch specific exception types. Throwing specific exception types allows the program to handle the exception in a more appropriate and meaningful way. Catching specific exception types also allows the program to handle the exception in a more appropriate and meaningful way.

For example, consider a program that reads data from a file. If the file does not exist, the program should throw a `FileNotFoundException`. If the program instead throws a general `Exception`, it would not provide any specific information about the error and would be more difficult to handle.

```java
try {
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    // code that uses the file input stream
} catch (Exception e) {
    // code to handle the exception
}
```

In this example, the catch block would catch any exception that is thrown, regardless of its type. This makes it difficult to determine the cause of the exception and to handle it in a meaningful way.

A better way to handle this scenario would be to catch only the `FileNotFoundException`.

```java
try {
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    // code that uses the file input stream
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // code to handle the FileNotFoundException
}
```

In this example, the catch block will only catch the FileNotFoundException, providing more specific information about the error.

Similarly, when creating custom exception classes, it's important to extend the appropriate exception class based on the type of exception being thrown. For example, if creating a custom exception to represent an invalid input, it would be appropriate to extend the IllegalArgumentException class.

```java
class InvalidInputException extends IllegalArgumentException {
    public InvalidInputException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `InvalidInputException` class extends the `IllegalArgumentException` class, indicating that it represents an invalid input. This makes it clear to other developers that this exception should be handled in the same way as an `IllegalArgumentException`.

It's also important to note that when handling exceptions, you should catch the most specific exception first and then catch the more general exception.

```java
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // code to handle the FileNotFoundException
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle the IOException
}
```

In this example, the `FileNotFoundException` is caught first, and the `IOException` is caught second. This is important because if the `IOException` catch block was placed before the `FileNotFoundException` catch block, the `FileNotFoundException` would never be caught, because it's a subclass of `IOException`.

In conclusion, throwing and catching specific exception types is important for providing specific information about errors and handling exceptions in a meaningful way. When creating custom exception classes, it's important to extend the appropriate exception class based on the type of exception being thrown. When handling exceptions, you should catch the most specific exception first and then catch the more general exception.

## How to create custom exception classes and when to use them

In Java, it's possible to create custom exception classes by extending the built-in exception classes. Creating custom exception classes allows you to provide more meaningful and specific information about an error, and to handle the error in a more appropriate way.

To create a custom exception class, you need to define a class that extends one of the built-in exception classes. For example, you can create a custom exception class that represents an invalid input by extending the `IllegalArgumentException` class.

```java
class InvalidInputException extends IllegalArgumentException {
    public InvalidInputException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `InvalidInputException` class is defined to extend the `IllegalArgumentException` class and has a constructor that takes a `String` parameter, which represents the error message.

You can also override the methods of the super class if needed.

```java
class InvalidInputException extends IllegalArgumentException {
    private final String invalidValue;
    public InvalidInputException(String message, String invalidValue) {
        super(message);
        this.invalidValue = invalidValue;
    }
    public String getInvalidValue() {
        return invalidValue;
    }
}
```

In this case, the `InvalidInputException` class has an additional attribute `invalidValue` and a method `getInvalidValue()` to access the value that caused the exception.

To use the custom exception class, you can throw it using the `throw` statement, and catch it using a `catch` block.

```java
try {
    if(input < 0) {
        throw new InvalidInputException("Invalid input value : " + input);
    }
    // code that uses the input
} catch (InvalidInputException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage() + " Value : " + e.invalidValue());
}
```

It's important to note that when creating custom exception classes, you should choose the appropriate built-in exception class to extend based on the type of exception being thrown. For example, if the exception represents an invalid input, it would be appropriate to extend the IllegalArgumentException class.

It's also important to give meaningful names to your custom exception class and provide a helpful message to the user.

### When to use custom exceptions?

Custom exceptions should be used when a specific exception is needed to handle a specific error condition. They are useful for providing more meaningful and specific information about an error, and for handling the error in a more appropriate way.

- When the standard exceptions do not provide enough information about an error.
- When you want to distinguish between different types of errors that can occur in your application.
- When you want to provide a more meaningful error message to the user.
- When you want to handle errors in a specific way.

It's important to use custom exceptions judiciously and only when they provide a clear benefit over using the standard exceptions.

In conclusion, creating custom exception classes in Java allows you to provide more meaningful and specific information about an error, and to handle the error in a more appropriate way. To create a custom exception class, you need to define a class that extends one of the built-in exception classes. When creating custom exception classes, it's important to choose the appropriate built-in exception class to extend based on the type of exception being thrown, and to give meaningful names to your custom exception class and provide a helpful message to the user.

# The finally block and try-with-resources

In Java, the finally block is an optional block of code that follows the try and catch blocks. The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. This block is typically used to release resources such as file handles, database connections, etc.

For example, consider a program that opens a file and reads data from it. If an exception is thrown while reading the data, the file should be closed. The following code illustrates how to use a finally block to close the file:

```java
FileInputStream fis = null;
try {
    fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
    // code that reads data from the file
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle the IOException
} finally {
    if (fis != null) {
        try {
            fis.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // code to handle the IOException
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the finally block is used to close the file input stream, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

It's important to note that the finally block is not executed if the program exits the try block by executing a return or break statement.

You can use the try-with-resources statement to automatically close resources, this statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement.

```java
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
    // code that uses the file input stream
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle the IOException
}
```

In this example, the FileInputStream is automatically closed at the end of the try block, even if an IOException is thrown. This eliminates the need for a finally block to close the resource.

The try-with-resources statement can also be used to close multiple resources, for example:

```java
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file1.txt");
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("file2.txt")) {
    // code that uses the file input and output streams
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle the IOException
}
```

It's important to note that in order for a resource to be used in a try-with-resources statement, it must implement the AutoCloseable interface. This interface defines a single method called close() that releases resources.

In conclusion, the finally block is an optional block of code in Java that is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not, typically used to release resources. The try-with-resources statement can be used to automatically close resources, eliminating the need for a finally block. The try-with-resources statement can be used to close multiple resources and can be used only with resources that implement the AutoCloseable interface. It's important to note that the finally block is not executed if the program exits the try block by executing a return or break statement.

# The difference between exceptions and errors and when to use each

In Java, exceptions and errors represent different types of problems that can occur during the execution of a program.

Exceptions represent conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch and handle. They are typically caused by programming errors, such as attempting to access an array index that is out of bounds, or trying to read from a file that does not exist. Java provides two main types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time and must be handled by the program, while unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time and typically represent programming errors.

Errors, on the other hand, represent serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Examples of errors include OutOfMemoryError and StackOverflowError. These are typically caused by system-level problems such as running out of memory or a stack overflow.

When to use exceptions?

- When a specific exception is needed to handle a specific error condition
- When the standard exceptions do not provide enough information about an error
- When you want to distinguish between different types of errors that can occur in your application
- When you want to provide a more meaningful error message to the user
- When you want to handle errors in a specific way

When to use errors?

- When the error is caused by a problem that cannot be reasonably recovered from
- When the error is a problem that is not caused by the application
- When the error is a problem that the application cannot handle

It's important to note that it's always a good practice to catch only the exception types that you can handle or provide a helpful message to the user. And also that it's not recommended to catch errors, they are typically unexpected and represent serious problems that the application cannot recover from.

For example:

```java
try {
    // code that might throw an exception
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // code to handle the FileNotFoundException
} catch (IOException e) {
    // code to handle the IOException
}
```

In this example, the FileNotFoundException and IOException are handled by the program, providing more specific information about the error and allowing the program to handle the exception in a more meaningful way.

```java
try {
    // code that might throw an error
} catch (Error e) {
    // code to handle the Error
}
```

In this example, the Error is caught by the program, this is not recommended as it's typically unexpected and represents a serious problem that the application cannot recover from. It's generally better to let the program terminate and provide an error message or log the error for further analysis.
