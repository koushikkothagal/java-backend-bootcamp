# Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the key concepts in object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, which helps to reduce code duplication and improves code reusability.

The basic syntax for inheritance in Java is as follows:

```java
class subclass_name extends superclass_name {
    // properties and methods
}
```

Here, the subclass_name is the name of the class that is inheriting from the superclass_name. The keyword `extends` is used to indicate that the subclass is inheriting from the superclass.

Let's take an example to understand this better. We have a class called `Animal` which has properties like `name` and `age`. We also have a class called `Dogs` which has additional properties like `breed` and `color`. We can use inheritance to create the `Dogs` class by inheriting from the `Animals` class.

```java
class Animals {
    String name;
    int age;
}

class Dogs extends Animals {
    String breed;
    String color;
}
```

In this example, the `Dogs` class inherits the properties `name` and `age` from the `Animals` class. This means that the `Dogs` class can use the properties `name` and `age` without having to define them again.

The subclass can also have its own methods and properties in addition to those inherited from the superclass.

```java
class Animals {
    String name;
    int age;
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("Animal eat");
    }
}

class Dogs extends Animals {
    String breed;
    String color;
    public void bark(){
        System.out.println("Dogs bark");
    }
}
```

Java also provides the ability to override methods of the superclass. This means that a subclass can provide a different implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.

```java
class Animals {
    String name;
    int age;
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("Animals eat");
    }
}

class Dogs extends Animals {
    String breed;
    String color;
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("Dogs eat differently");
    }
    public void bark(){
        System.out.println("Dogs bark");
    }
}
```

There is also a `super` keyword, which is used to call the superclass version of an overridden method.

```java
class Animals {
    String name;
    int age;
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("Animals eat");
    }
}

class Dogs extends Animals {
    String breed;
    String color;
    public void eat(){
        super.eat();
        System.out.println("Dogs eat differently");
    }
    public void bark(){
        System.out.println("Dogs bark");
    }
}
```

In addition to single inheritance, Java also supports multi-level inheritance, where a class can inherit from a class that inherits from another class. This allows for a more complex class hierarchy and can further improve code reusability.

```java
class Animals {
    String name;
    int age;
    public void eat(){
        System.out.println("Animals eat");
    }
}

class Mammals extends Animals {
    int numberOfLegs;
    public void walk(){
        System.out.println("Mammals walk");
    }
}

class Dogs extends Mammals {
    String breed;
    String color;
    public void eat(){
        super.eat();
        System.out.println("Dogs eat differently");
    }
    public void bark(){
        System.out.println("Dogs bark");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Dogs` class inherits from the `Mammals` class, which in turn inherits from the `Animals` class. This allows the `Dogs` class to access properties and methods from both the `Mammals` and `Animals` class.

:::note
Java does not support multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple classes. However, the interface feature in Java can be used to achieve similar functionality.

In conclusion, inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows for code reusability and improves the structure of your code. It is important to understand the basics of inheritance, including the syntax, the `extends` keyword, method overriding, and the `super` keyword. With the help of this feature, we can create a well-organized class hierarchy and reduce code duplication.
