# Best Practices

Lambda expressions and functional interfaces are powerful features that allow for more concise and expressive code. However, to make the most of these features, it's important to follow certain best practices. In this lecture, we will cover best practices for writing lambda expressions and functional interfaces, including considerations for performance, debugging, and testing.

## Performance Considerations

1.  When using lambda expressions, it's important to avoid any unnecessary computations. For example, if you're filtering a stream of data, it's best to filter it as early as possible, rather than first mapping the data and then filtering it. This will prevent unnecessary computations and improve performance.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

// Bad practice: map first and then filter
List<Integer> filteredNumbers = numbers.stream()
    .map(number -> number * 2)
    .filter(number -> number > 10)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Good practice: filter first and then map
List<Integer> filteredNumbers = numbers.stream()
    .filter(number -> number > 5)
    .map(number -> number * 2)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

2.  Use parallel streams with caution: When working with large data sets, using parallel streams can improve performance. However, using parallel streams can also lead to unexpected results and concurrency issues, so it's important to use them with caution.

## Debugging and Testing

1.  Use meaningful variable names: When using lambda expressions and functional interfaces, it's important to use meaningful variable names, as these variables can be difficult to understand and debug.

```java
// Bad practice: using meaningless variable names
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
List<Integer> a = numbers.stream()
    .filter(n -> n > 5)
    .map(n -> n * 2)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Good practice: using meaningful variable names
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
List<Integer> filteredAndDoubledNumbers = numbers.stream()
    .filter(number -> number > 5)
    .map(largerNumber -> largerNumber * 2)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

2.  Test your lambda expressions: Testing lambda expressions can be tricky, as they're often used as method arguments, and therefore may not have direct access to their internal logic. However, it is still important to test your lambda expressions to ensure that they are behaving as expected. One way to do this is by testing the methods that accept lambda expressions as arguments, and verifying that the correct results are returned.

```java
// Example of testing a method that accepts a lambda expression as an argument
@Test
public void testFilterMethod() {
    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
    List<Integer> expectedResult = Arrays.asList(6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
    List<Integer> result = filterNumbers(numbers, n -> n > 5);
    assertEquals(expectedResult, result);
}

public List<Integer> filterNumbers(List<Integer> numbers, Predicate<Integer> predicate) {
    return numbers.stream().filter(predicate).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

## Considerations for Functional Interfaces

1.  Use pre-existing functional interfaces when possible: Java provides several functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Predicate`, `Consumer`, and `Function`.
2.  Limit the number of methods in functional interfaces: As discussed earlier, functional interfaces should have only one abstract method. However, it's also a good practice to limit the number of other methods in general, as this makes the interface easier to understand and implement.
3.  Annotate functional interfaces with `@FunctionalInterface`: The `@FunctionalInterface `annotation is optional, but it provides an additional level of type safety by ensuring that the interface can only be implemented by exactly one abstract method.
